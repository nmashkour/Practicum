# New York City Department of Health: Risk Segmentation Model Approach for Restaurants

## Description

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is responsible for regulating 24,000 restaurants. At least once per year, the Department conducts inspections randomly, with a holistic approach (i.e. food handling, food temperature, personal hygiene, and vermin control).The Departmentâ€™s main goal is to achieve high quality standards in the establishments.

## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to enhance DOH analytical capabilities by pinpointing trends in NYC's inspection outcomes, crafting a segmented model approach that informs the Department with an interactive dashboard.

Our analysis aims to better inform inspectors what to look for, optimizing the inspection appointment and creating more targeted inspections. Overall, it will be a more efficient system for DOH inspections, acting as a supplementary tool to create an ecosystem of more sanitary conditions in NYC restaurants.
